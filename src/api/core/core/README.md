# Generic REST API Endpoint Specification Core
This folder contains code defining the core concepts related to REST API endpoints specification:
- [data validation for input and output](./data.ts),
- [what REST API endpoint should have in order to be useable](./endpoint.ts),
- [available HTTP methods](./methods.ts), and
- [miscellaneous utilies](./utils.ts).

The code is mostly composed of type specifications - there is very little runtime code involved.
