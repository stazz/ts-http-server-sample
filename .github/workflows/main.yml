# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  # push:
  #   branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  # workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  test:

      matrix:
        node-version:
